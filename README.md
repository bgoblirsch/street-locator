# street-locator
A barebones alternative to [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). Being a geography nerd, I used to love playing Geoguessr and was quite sad to find that it went pay to play. You are unfortunately allowed to play only one game per day (which consists of five guesses). I figured it would be a fun project to recreate the game myself. The dev console will log how far off your guess was and you must refresh the page for the next round but this was more than enough to get my Geoguessr fix in. Feel free to fork the code and play yourself or improve upon it.

You will have to generate your own [Google Maps API key detailed here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and replace it on line 7 in index.html. Feel free to shoot me an email if you would just like to demo it out with my API key.
